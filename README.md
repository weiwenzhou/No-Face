## Description of Dataset
We would be using a dataset of population of countries from 1800 to 2100. By representing this data, we could easily study the demographics and the ongoing trend of human population in each country. 
[Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Ep3s1S0cvlT1ovQG9KdipLEoQ1Ktz5LtTTQpDcWbX0/edit?fbclid=IwAR2jyskV6_9ngphh320K3Q0MtmshKmaupYqNLCYaBI4gf2LMHA1T1x1u8u8#gid=1863690772)

## Explanation of How to Make the Data Come Alive
There would be diagrams that are labeled of each country. Users could click on a diagram to enlarge it and show the population of the country. Users would also be able to change the year through the use of a slider. Users would be able to find out the trend of human population and would be left wondering the causes of the trend.

## Explanation of D3 Features
Our project would be similar to [this](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2206590). We will have the enlargening feature when a user clicks on a country to display information on that country. When the user changes the year by using the slider the data will updated and show the population compared to the previous or next years. Users would be able to return to the map of the countries and look at the data for another country by clicking on it.
